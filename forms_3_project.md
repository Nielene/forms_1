# Mars Mission Registration Form - Part 3

Refactor your Mars mission registration form to include a `form` tag with a `submit` input. Your `submit` input, by default, should be hidden, and should only be revealed when your user has completed their form (A.K.A. `formCompleted` is `true`).

Fundamentally, this is what submitting the form should look like:

- User clicks on "Confirm" button, which is not a `submit` input, but a regular old `button` tag connected to a function.
- Once the user clicks "Confirm", their form responses are shown, and the `submit` tag is revealed.
- User clicks the `submit` tag, triggering the `form`'s `onSubmit` function.

Make sure that your styling is how you want it, and then blast off from this project!
